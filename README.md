# Quantitative-Momentum-SP500

Recommending to a client a certain number of shares to be bought for 50 top performing S&amp;P500 stocks based on quantitative momentum, resulting in an equal-weighted portfolio of those 50 stocks. First, I use a naive approach for it, using just one year returns. Afterwards, I differentiate between high-quality and low-quality momentum to recommend high-quality stocks only. The dataset used is in the "sp_500_stocks.csv" file and the "momentum_strategy.xlsx" file contains some sample output.
